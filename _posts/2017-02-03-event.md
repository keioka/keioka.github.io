# Event

### Event list

[Browser Event List](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)


### What is event loop?

Event loop is the way javascript deals with events. If `onClick` event is settled, one handler such as `function removeButton(){}` should be also settled.
  
Those set is contained inside Event Queue which is FIFO data structure.
Once previous event is execute, next queued set is executed and processed. This loop will end until queue is empty. javascript is single thread so that next event handler will not be executed unless previous one is done.

#### What is the difference between call stack and task queue?

  * call stack: A call stack is a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program. This kind of stack is also known as an execution stack, control stack, run-time stack, or machine stack, and is often shortened to just "the stack".
  
  * task queue : A job queue (sometimes batch queue), is a data structure maintained by job scheduler software containing jobs to run.

### Explain event delegation

- JavaScript event delegation is a simple technique by which you add a single event handler to a parent element in order to avoid having to add event handlers to multiple child elements.

- Event delegation allows you to avoid adding event listeners to specific nodes;  instead, the event listener is added to one parent.  


```html
<ul id="parent">
  <li class="children">1</li>
  <li class="children">2</li>
  <li class="children">3</li>
  <li class="children">4</li>
  <li class="children">5</li>
</ul>
```

Not work
```javascript
window.onload = function(){
  document.getElementsByClassName('children').addEventListener("click", function(e){
  });
  // document.getElementsByClassName(...).addEventListener is not a function
};
```
Since `getElementsByClassName` returns array, we have to iterate each node and attach event listener on each of them. So that event delegation works effectively in this case.

OK
```javascript
window.onload = function(){
  document.getElementById('parent').addEventListener("click", function(e){
    if (e.target && e.target.nodeName == "LI") {
      e.target.innerHTML = "Hello"
    }
  });
};
```

### Describe event bubbling.

JavaScript allows DOM elements to be nested inside each other. In such a case, if the handler of the child is clicked, the handler of parent will also work as if it were clicked too.

### Difference between document load event and document DOMContentLoaded event?

The DOMContentLoaded event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading. A very different event - load - should be used only to detect a fully-loaded page. It is an incredibly popular mistake to use load where DOMContentLoaded would be much more appropriate, so be cautious.

The load event is fired when a resource and its dependent resources have finished loading.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/DOMContentLoaded

```javascript
window.onload = function(){
  console.log("Window.onload");
}

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event) {
  console.log("DOM fully loaded and parsed");
});

document.onreadystatechange = function () {
  if (document.readyState == "interactive") {
    console.log("Interactive");
  }

  if (document.readyState == "loading") {
    console.log("Loading");
  }

  if (document.readyState == "complete") {
    console.log("Complete");
  }
}

// Interactive 
// DOM fully loaded and parsed 
// Complete 
// Window.onload
```

A page can't be manipulated safely until the document is "ready." jQuery detects this state of readiness for you. Code included inside $( document ).ready() will only run once the page Document Object Model (DOM) is ready for JavaScript code to execute. Code included inside $( window ).load(function() { ... }) will run once the entire page (images or iframes), not just the DOM, is ready.

### Why would you use something like the `load` event? Does this event have disadvantages? Do you know any alternatives, and why would you use those?

### setTimeOut

In what order will the numbers 1-4 be logged to the console when the code below is executed? Why?
```javascript
(function() {
    console.log(1); 
    setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000); 
    setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0); 
    console.log(4);
})();
```

> The browser has an event loop which checks the event queue and processes pending events. For example, if an event happens in the background (e.g., a script onload event) while the browser is busy (e.g., processing an onclick), the event gets appended to the queue. When the onclick handler is complete, the queue is checked and the event is then handled (e.g., the onload script is executed).

> Similarly, setTimeout() also puts execution of its referenced function into the event queue if the browser is busy.

> When a value of zero is passed as the second argument to setTimeout(), it attempts to execute the specified function “as soon as possible”. Specifically, execution of the function is placed on the event queue to occur on the next timer tick. Note, though, that this is not immediate; the function is not executed until the next tick. That’s why in the above example, the call to console.log(4) occurs before the call to console.log(3) (since the call to console.log(3) is invoked via setTimeout, so it is slightly delayed).
