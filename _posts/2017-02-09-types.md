# Types

Javascript has types and subtypes of object. Array, Function, RegExp are not types but sub -type of object called natives. Truly, `typeof []` returns object. string, number, boolean are types and those value called primitive value.

## So what is primitive value and Natives?

### primitive value type

JavaScript has seven built-in types: null, undefined, boolean, number, string, object, symbol. They can be identified by the typeof operator.

```javascript
string
number
boolean
null
undefined
object
symbol (ES6)
```

When you call `typeof null`, it returns `object`. However it is own primitive type null. It is not object and undefined as well.
`null` and `undefined` are different. `null` is assigned mostly explicitly. `undefined` means any value is not assigned.

##### Symbol

Symbols are new to JavaScript in ECMAScript Edition 6. A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property (see below).


### Built in Object (Natives)

```javascript
String()
Number()
Boolean()
Array()
Object()
Function()
RegExp()
Date()
Error()
Symbol() -- added in ES6!
```
Natives are Built in Object create by constructor function and creates object which has sub type of object. Each prototype of [[prototype]] is object.

```javascript
typeof [] === "object" // true
```

Every objects work like this.

### What happened when you call methods onto primitive value.

```javascript
var message = "a"
a.length; // 1
a.toUpperCase(); // "A"
```

`var message` contains primitive value "a" and type "string" which is not a object and does not have any method.
So what happened here is that "a" is convert to wrapped object which is called natives (native type).


### What is the result of following code?

```javascript
var message = "Hello, Kei"
message instanceof String
```
This result is `false` because message is primitive value string.
If you want to get value true, you need to..

```javascript
var message = new String("Hello, Kei")
message instanceof String
```

You have to box the primitive value by wrapper native String which is object.

### What is the result

```javascript
var a = new Boolean( false );

if (!a) {
    console.log( "Oops" );
} else if (a) {
    console.log( "a is truthy");
}
```

since a is wrapped by an object wrapper

```javascript
var a = new Boolean( false );
// Boolean {[[PrimitiveValue]]: false} <- chrome
```
a is truthy because a contains object whose sub-type is Boolean.

### Small Decimal

```javascript
0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3; // false
```
Simply put, the representations for 0.1 and 0.2 in binary floating-point are not exact, so when they are added, the result is not exactly 0.3. It's really close: 0.30000000000000004, but if your comparison fails, "close" is irrelevant.

# How do you unbox natives (wrapped object)?
If you get primitive value from the object, you can call `valueOf()` function.

```javascript
var string = new String( "kei" );
var number = new Number( 28 );
var boolean = new Boolean( true );

string.valueOf(); // "kei"
number.valueOf(); // 28
boolean.valueOf(); // true
```

### How do you check internal [[Class]] values? and what happened when you check type primitive value?

[[Class]] does not mean class oriented programming.

```javascript
Object.prototype.toString.call( "abc" );    // "[object String]"
Object.prototype.toString.call( 42 );       // "[object Number]"
Object.prototype.toString.call( true );     // "[object Boolean]"
```
primitive value will boxed by natives.



### What is the difference between `==` and `===`?

short answer: `==` converts type of value but `===` is type sensitive.

```javascript
0 == '0' // true
0 === '0' // false

null == undefined // true
null === undefined // false

true == 1; true
true === 1; false

var a = [1,2,3];
var b = [1,2,3];

a == b //false
a === b //false

var c = [1,2,3];
var d = c;

c == d // true
c === d // true
```

### What's the difference between a variable that is: `null`, `undefined`, `NaN` or undeclared?
typeof null is "object" but typeof undefined is "undefined".
In JavaScript, undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value, such as:

  * How would you go about checking for any of these states?
  * What is a potential pitfall with using typeof bar === "object" to determine if bar is an object? How can this pitfall be avoided?
  Because bar could be null and null is also "Object"
  * NaN means “not a number”, its type is Number
  * A variable whose value is null was explicitly given a value of null , which means that the variable was explicitly set to have no value.


```javascript
console.log(typeof null); // Object
console.log(typeof undefined); // undefined
console.log(typeof NaN === "number");  // true
```

Difference between `undefined` and `undeclared` is that whether variable or function is declared or not. `NaN` is not invalid number but type is number.

```javascript
var a;
console.log(a); // undefined
console.log(b); // RefereneceError b is not declared
```


The value of a variable with no value is undefined (i.e., it has not been initialized). Variables can be emptied by setting their value to null. You can test for each using the === (three equal signs) or == (two equal signs) for comparison checking. The big difference is the latter uses coercion, which can have some odd results — it returns true for a null or undefined comparison if they are either.

```javascript
if (nullExample === null) { // executes this block only if null }
if (undExample === undefined) { // executes this block only if Undefined }
```

```javascript
if (bothExampe == null) { // executes this block if Undefined or null }
```

You can be more exact with a comparison by using the typeof to return an object's type.

If (typeof variable === "undefined")  { // executes this block of if undefined }

### What's the difference between host objects and native objects?
Native objects: Object (constructor), Date, Math, parseInt, eval, string methods like indexOf and replace, array methods, ...

Host objects (assuming browser environment): window, document, location, history, XMLHttpRequest, setTimeout, getElementsByTagName, querySelectorAll,
Objects like window, XmlHttpRequest, DOM nodes and so on, which is provided by the browser environment.
